			<p>Enter as many URLs as you want in the form below. Then, when you are in the 
			shower basin, use the iButton reader to start your playlist.
			As you leave just use your iButton again to stop.</p>

			<h2>Tips</h2>
			<ul id='tip_list'>
				<li>Make sure your file extensions actually match the file type. Some people 
				are assholes.</li>
				<li>One URL per line. If you fuck shit up and give a bad URL, the file will 
				just be skipped. No fun at all.</li>
				<li>Only you can stop your playlist. This prevents others from being bitches, 
				but it also commands responsibility.</li>
				<li>Your playlist is persistent, and stored in a tidy little Redis store. 
				You don't need to set up your playlist every time you shower. Heck, it'll
				even be there when you come back to this interface.</li>
				<li>The reason for the iButton readers is to prevent shower sniping. You know
				how shitty it is to go find a shower that's empty, go back and set up SOAP,
				and then go back to the shower to find it taken?</li>
				<li>You can totally use the iButton box as a hangar. See, it's not that bad.</li>
